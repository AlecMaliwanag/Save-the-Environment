# Save the Environment
Let's save our settings for a better future.

## Sublime Text
* use Tomorrow Night theme
* use Vintageous for vim keybindings
* highlight current line and emphasize matching braces
* use 2 spaces instead of tabs

## Bash
Be sure to move or append the .bash_profile file to an existing /Users/yourusername/.bash_profile â€“ you can also run `source User/.bash_profile` to activate customizations.
* use colored output for directories and files
* add Unicode octopus to prompt to distinguish local shells
